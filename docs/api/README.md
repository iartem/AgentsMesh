# AgentsMesh API Documentation

## Overview

AgentsMesh provides APIs for managing multi-agent AI development workspaces:

- **REST API**: For web/mobile clients (authentication, resources, management)
- **gRPC + mTLS**: For Runner connections (bidirectional streaming, certificate-based authentication)

The platform supports multi-tenancy, OAuth authentication, and real-time terminal streaming.

## Base URL

- Production: `https://api.agentsmesh.io/api/v1`
- Staging: `https://staging-api.agentsmesh.example.com/api/v1`
- Development: `http://localhost:10000/api/v1` (via Traefik)

## Authentication

### JWT Authentication

Most endpoints require JWT authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Obtaining a Token

#### Email/Password Login

```http
POST /api/v1/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "your-password"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...",
  "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "username": "johndoe",
    "name": "John Doe"
  }
}
```

#### OAuth Login

Supported providers: GitHub, Google, GitLab, Gitee

```http
GET /api/v1/auth/oauth/{provider}?redirect=/dashboard
```

### Token Refresh

```http
POST /api/v1/auth/refresh
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..."
}
```

## Multi-Tenancy

Organization-scoped endpoints require the organization slug in the URL path:

```
/api/v1/organizations/{slug}/...
```

## gRPC API (Runner Communication)

Runners connect to the backend via gRPC with mTLS (mutual TLS) authentication.

### Endpoint

- Production: `grpcs://api.agentmesh.io:9443`
- Development: `grpcs://localhost:9443`

### Authentication

Runners authenticate using client certificates issued by the AgentMesh PKI:

1. **Registration**: Runner obtains a certificate via `RegisterWithToken` or browser-based authorization
2. **Connection**: Runner presents certificate during TLS handshake
3. **Validation**: Nginx validates certificate and passes CN to backend via gRPC metadata

### Service Definition

```protobuf
service RunnerService {
  // Bidirectional streaming for Runner ↔ Backend communication
  rpc Connect(stream RunnerMessage) returns (stream ServerMessage);

  // Certificate registration (before mTLS setup)
  rpc RegisterWithToken(RegisterWithTokenRequest) returns (RegisterWithTokenResponse);
  rpc GetAuthStatus(GetAuthStatusRequest) returns (GetAuthStatusResponse);
}
```

### Message Types

**Server → Runner:**
- `CreatePodCommand`: Create a new pod with specified agent
- `TerminatePodCommand`: Stop and cleanup a pod
- `TerminalInputCommand`: Send input to pod's terminal
- `TerminalResizeCommand`: Resize terminal dimensions
- `PromptCommand`: Send prompt to agent

**Runner → Server:**
- `PodCreatedEvent`: Pod successfully created
- `PodTerminatedEvent`: Pod terminated (with exit code)
- `TerminalOutputEvent`: Terminal output data
- `AgentStatusEvent`: Agent state change
- `HeartbeatData`: Periodic health check

## WebSocket Endpoints (Web Client)

### Terminal WebSocket (via Relay)

```
ws://localhost:10000/relay/terminal/{pod_key}?token=<jwt>
```

Connect to a pod's terminal for real-time input/output via Relay service.

### Events WebSocket

```
ws://localhost:10000/api/v1/orgs/{slug}/ws/events
```

Subscribe to real-time events. Supports filtering by event type.

## Error Responses

All errors return JSON with the following structure:

```json
{
  "error": "Error message"
}
```

Common HTTP status codes:
- `400` - Bad Request (validation error)
- `401` - Unauthorized (missing or invalid token)
- `403` - Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- `404` - Not Found
- `409` - Conflict (duplicate resource)
- `500` - Internal Server Error

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate-limited. When exceeded, you'll receive:

```
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Retry-After: 60
```
