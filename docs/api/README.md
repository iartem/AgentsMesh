# AgentsMesh API Documentation

## Overview

AgentsMesh provides a RESTful API for managing multi-agent AI development workspaces. The API supports multi-tenancy, OAuth authentication, and real-time WebSocket connections.

## Base URL

## Authentication

### JWT Authentication

Most endpoints require JWT authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Obtaining a Token

#### Email/Password Login

```http
POST /api/v1/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "your-password"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...",
  "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "username": "johndoe",
    "name": "John Doe"
  }
}
```

#### OAuth Login

Supported providers: GitHub, Google, GitLab, Gitee

```http
GET /api/v1/auth/oauth/{provider}?redirect=/dashboard
```

### Token Refresh

```http
POST /api/v1/auth/refresh
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..."
}
```

## Multi-Tenancy

```
/api/v1/organizations/{slug}/...
```
